## Resume

[My resume](https://github.com/kuroyi/resume/releases/download/latest/rick-haines.pdf) created using the Awesome-CV template and automated with Awesome-CV-action.

## Credit

[**Awesome CV**](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) is LaTeX template for a **CV(Curriculum Vitae)**, **Résumé** or **Cover Letter** inspired by [Fancy CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/fancy-cv). It is easy to customize your own template, especially since it is really written by a clean, semantic markup.

[**Awesome-CV-action**](https://github.com/olivierodo/Awesome-CV-action) is a github action to create a release from a push and add your generated resume.pdf to the release.

[**LaTeX**](https://www.latex-project.org) is a fantastic typesetting program that a lot of people use these days, especially the math and computer science people in academia.

[**LaTeX FontAwesome**](https://github.com/furl/latex-fontawesome) is bindings for FontAwesome icons to be used in XeLaTeX.
